# LinkedList

* This project implements a multitude of methods that can be used to
  alter a sequence object. This sequence mimics the C++ vector class or a linked list. 
  A Sequence object is made of SequenceNodes that are linked to each other with a previous 
  and next pointer. Each sequence has one head and one tail. Each sequence node contains an 
  integer as it's element or data.
  
* The test harness is what was used to test that all the sequence methods work as intended, 
  and the output verifies itself.
